## 🎉 Your Project is Ready!

This project has been created with a complete planning and documentation structure. Everything you need to plan, build, and ship your SaaS is here.

---

## 🚀 Three Steps to Get Started

### 1. Get Oriented (2 minutes)

**What you have:**
- ✅ Complete folder structure for planning and documentation
- ✅ Templates ready to use
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ VS Code workspace configured

**Where things are:**
- `product/` - PRDs, roadmaps, features
- `sprints/` - Sprint plans, user stories
- `technical/` - Tech specs, ADRs, API docs
- `business/` - OKRs, metrics, goals
- `meetings/` - Notes, interviews

### 2. (Optional) Add Your Initial Vision

**Have a project brief ready?**

Open `project-brief/brief.md` and paste your vision. You can also add:
- `project-brief/vision.md` - Long-term vision
- `project-brief/target-users.md` - User personas
- Or create your own `.md` files in `project-brief/`

Claude automatically reads ALL files in `project-brief/` during planning!

**Or skip this** - Claude will ask you questions.

### 3. Start Planning

Open Claude Code and say:

> **"Help me get started with this project"**

Claude will guide you through creating your roadmap, sprint plan, and initial documents.
